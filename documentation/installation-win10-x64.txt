                    =======================
                    ServerLink Installation
                    =======================


Any version numbers shown below are known to work at this time.

Serverlink Supported OS: Windows 10 v1909 64bit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:

1. Install DB.Browser.for.SQLite-3.11.2-win32.msi from https://sqlitebrowser.org/

Notes:
    - none at the time of this writing

2. Install OpenJDK8U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_8u232b09.msi from https://adoptopenjdk.net/

Notes:

    - Use the OpenJDK 8 (LTS) version.  LTS means "Long Term Support".

    - During installation:

        (a) The installer defaults to "Add to Path" and "Associate .jar".  If you
        have no other copies of java on your pc then this is a safe option.  If
        you are a developer, then selecting this option might interfere with your
        existing copie(s) of java.

        (b) The default install location (assuming you have a "c" drive ) is:
            C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-8.0.232.09-hotspot\
        This will be fine for serverlink.

        (c) If you are a developing software the other options might be of
        interest to you, but are not required for serverlink.

    -  To verify your installation, assuming you had the same path as I do here,
    you should now have a file called "java.exe" in the following location:
        
        C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-8.0.232.09-hotspot\bin
    
    Your version numbers in the above will be different if you use a version of
    java released after the date of this writing.

    It is important that you have this file.  If you cannot find this file you
    cannot proceed.

3.  Get a copy of the serverlink software from the github repo releases folder.
You can place it anywhere on your hard drive, including your desktop.  It does
not require any administrative priveledges.  Also be sure to download from
releases the ServerLink.DB and ServerLink.ini files.

4.  For this example, we will have a copy at c:\serverlink

    You should have the folllowing files:

    - ServerLink.DB     (This is your new database file)
    - ServerLink.ini    (This is your serverlink config file)
    - serverlink-1.0.1-win10x64-openjdk1.8.0_152.jar (this is the serverlink software)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        ServerLink Configuration
                        ========================

1.  Generate Admin account user and password for database:

This new forked version now includes a wizard to generate the database
admin username, passwordHash and salt.  You will take these values
and manually put them into the ServerLink.db database.

Hopefully in time we will further enhance serverlink to automate the
database editing.

NOTE:  if you get confused, serverlink can print some help on the console, if
you run the application with no other arguments:

Open windows command prompt, and run:
"C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-8.0.232.09-hotspot\bin\java.exe" -jar serverlink-1.0.0-win10x64-openjdk1.8.0_152.jar

Open windows command prompt, and start the wizard with:
"C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-8.0.232.09-hotspot\bin\java.exe" -jar serverlink-1.0.0-win10x64-openjdk1.8.0_152.jar wizard

Now we will edit the database by hand using the "DB Browser for SQLite" we
installed earlier.

- Doubleclick on the ServerLink.db (You might have to tell Windows 10 to use
the "DB Browser for SQLite" to open the file, if so it's most likely located
in C:\Program Files (x86)\DB Browser for SQLite)

- In "DB Browser for SQLite" click on the "Browse Data" tab.

- Near upper left of the program window select "ServerAccount" from the "Table"
drop down.

- You will need to enter your db admin's accountId, username, passwordHash
and salt values here that you received from the wizard.

- Once Completed, click on "Write Changes" and then "Close Database"

2.  Edit UT2004.ini:

We need to verify that the ServerLink section of your UT2004.ini file refelect
the above:

[3SPNv3228D.TeamArenaMaster]
ServerLinkStatus=SL_ENABLED
ServerLinkAddress=127.0.0.1     <---- See note below
ServerLinkPort=9090             <---- 9090 is serverlink's default. If you
                                      change this, be sure ServerLink.ini 
                                      reflects this (see next section).
ServerLinkAccount=              <---- put db admin username here
ServerLinkPassword=             <---- put db admin password (not hash) here

NOTE:  The master serverlink software allows serverlink to listen to BOTH the
local or public internet.  This might be altered in future releases
to only be local (127.0.0.1) or public via a configuration option, but has not
been modified at this time, 20191221.  If you're running serverlink on the 
same physical pc as the game server, I recommend using 127.0.0.1 loopback local
interface if you can.

3.  Edit ServerLink.ini:

[ServerLink]
port = 9090                             <---- should match UT2004.ini, 9090 is
                                              serverlink default value
thread_pool = 16
database_options = ServerLink.db        <---- name of your database file
allow_anonymous = false

4.  Start the serverlink server:

Most likely you are using Windows Explorer as your file manager, and are viewing
the contents of "C:\serverlink" folder.

In the address bar of Windows Explorer, type in the location bar: "cmd.exe"
and a Windows console should open.

Verify that your console is in same directory as explorer by typing "dir" into
console, and you should see all the serverlink files.

It you are not seeing those files, then try in console:
cd C:\serverlink

Your console should show:
    C:\serverlink>

Remember during installation I told you that you needed the location of "java.exe"
Well now we will use it by putting the following commandline into the Windows
Console Window (be sure to keep the quotation marks):

"C:\Program Files\AdoptOpenJDK\jdk-8.0.232.09-hotspot\bin\java.exe" -jar serverlink-1.0.1-win10x64-openjdk1.8.0_152.jar ServerLink.ini ServerLink.db

If successful, you should see this:
{ServerLink=[{port=[9090], thread_pool=[16], database_options=[ServerLink.db], allow_anonymous=[false]}]}
ServerLink - Starting on 9090.
ServerLink - Starting with 16 threads.

5.  Start Unreal Tournament 2004 game server the way you always do.

6.  Statistics will not be shown until a match has been played to its entirety
and the game server changes maps.  The second match should have the stats
working properly.

7.  Profit.  gl hf!

                        Conclusion
                        ==========

Now that you have finished your installation.  You might want to consider
putting the Windows Console commands into a Windows Batch Script File.

That is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
